# Chapter Leader Intro Slideshow

This particular version of the tap-deck is to give Operation Code Chapter Leaders
an Introduction Slide Show for their first Meetups.

Controls:
- Left and right arrows navigate through Slides
- Escape brings up a slide overview
- "F" puts slides into full-screen

Slides to be shown before TAP briefings. Written using reveal.js.

You can view the show at http://operationcode.github.io/tap-deck
